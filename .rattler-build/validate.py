    # - Check python version in pyproject.toml against rattler-build recipe
    # - Check host dependencies in pyproject.toml against rattler-build recipe
    # - Check "Specifiers" compatibility (e.g. >=, ==, etc.). This is not entirely trivial because of the different
    #   ways that dependencies can be specified in pyproject.toml and rattler-build recipes. (e.g. git urls, etc.).
    # - Address the fact that while the definition of "latest" on the rattler-build side is pinned to our local channel
    #   (for packages on the local channel, e.g. lithops, lonboard fork, etc.), the definition of "latest" on the
    #   pyproject.toml side is pinned to the latest version available on PyPI. This is a potential source of inconsistency,
    #   and may need to be addressed by a nightly check of PyPI for new versions of packages that we depend on (or similar).
    # - Explicit optionals variants for rattler recipe, and compare these against pyproject.toml
