# ecoscope-workflows

This repository contains 7 distinct Python packages. Of those, the two contained under `src/` represent the core logic developed in this repo:

```
src
├── ecoscope-workflows-core
└── ecoscope-workflows-ext-ecoscope
```

- [`ecoscope-workflows-core`](./src/ecoscope-workflows-core/README.md) is a code generator that provides a specification for defining workflows (i.e. DAGs) of Python callables (known as `@task`s) in YAML, as well as a CLI for compiling these YAML DAG definitions into installable packages. The package generated by this compilation process provides both REST API and CLI entrypoints for running the specified workflow.
- [`ecoscope-workflows-ext-ecoscope`](./src/ecoscope-workflows-ext-ecoscope/README.md) is a task extension package which, when installed, registers additional `@task`s with the core compiler that wrap logic provided by [`ecoscope`](https://github.com/wildlife-dynamics/ecoscope).

The remaining 5 packages in this repo are examples of the types of workflow packages which can be generated by this framework. The structure of each subdirectory in the `examples` directory adheres to the following format:

```
examples
└── <EXAMPLE-NAME>
    ├── ecoscope-workflows-<EXAMPLE-NAME>-workflow
    ├── spec.yaml
    └── test-cases.yaml
```
where:

- `EXAMPLE-NAME` is the workflow author's selected name for this example
- `spec.yaml` is the specification defining
- `test-cases.yaml` is a user
- `ecoscope-workflows-<EXAMPLE-NAME>-workflow` is the dynamically generated package. _**Note**: All code in this subdirectory is machine-generated. It should not be manually edited._
